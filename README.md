#AtharvS Token
This Solidity program showcases a basic token implementation, allowing users to mint and burn tokens. It provides a simple demonstration of Solidity syntax and token functionality. 
##About
This Solidity program represents a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes two functions, mintToken and burnToken, which enable the creation and destruction of tokens.

####How to use
To execute the code and interact with the contract, you can follow the steps outlined in the previous response using Remix. Remix is an online Solidity IDE that allows you to write, compile, and deploy smart contracts.
Once you have deployed the contract, you can interact with it by calling the mintToken and burnToken functions. You can also access the totalSupply variable to retrieve the total value.
